    "####  DELETE and TRUNCATE are Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations while DROP is a Data Definition Language (DDL) operation. DROP command removes a table from the database. DELETE is a Data Manipulation Language Command (DML). It is used to delete one or more tuples of a table. With the help of the `DELETE` command, we can either delete all the rows in one go or can delete rows one by one. i.e., we can use it as per the requirement or the condition using the Where clause. It is comparatively slower than the TRUNCATE command. The TRUNCATE command does not remove the structure of the table."

    "#### The difference between JOIN and UNION is that JOIN combines the tuples from two relations and the resultant tuples include attributes from both the relations. On the other hand, the UNION combines the result of two SELECT queries. The JOIN clause is applicable only when the two relations involved have at least one attribute common in both. UNION puts lines from queries after each other, while JOIN makes a cartesian product and subsets it â€“ completely different operations."

    "#### Clustered and non-clustered indexes are two types of indexes in SQL Server. A clustered index determines how the data is stored in the rows of a table. It sorts and stores the data rows in the table based on their key values. The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages themselves. In contrast, a non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location. It does not sort and store the data pages themselves but instead stores pointers to the data pages. Non-clustered indexes are stored in a separate structure from the data rows, which means that they can be created on columns that are not part of the primary key or clustered index."
