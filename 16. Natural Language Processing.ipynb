    "- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It combines computational linguistics and machine learning techniques to help computers understand human language in text or speech format.\n",
    "- Traditional data processing involves structured data that is organized in a specific format such as tables or spreadsheets. In contrast, NLP deals with unstructured data such as text, audio, or video data that is not organized in a predefined manner."

    "#### When performing NLP tasks, missing or incomplete data can be handled in several ways. One way is to use imputation techniques to fill in the missing data. Another way is to use data augmentation techniques to generate more data from the existing data. A third way is to use transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models on similar tasks and fine-tune them on the current task.\n",
    "#### However, it’s important to note that the effectiveness of these techniques depends on the specific task and the amount of missing or incomplete data. It’s also important to evaluate the performance of the model on a validation set that contains missing or incomplete data to ensure that the model is robust and generalizes well."

    "#### Tokenization is a process in natural language processing (NLP) that splits up a sentence or phrase into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, dates, punctuation marks, or even parts of words. The purpose of tokenization is to make it easier for a computer to understand human language. Tokenization not only simplifies the subsequent processes in the NLP pipeline but also enables the model to understand the context and semantic relationships between words. It is an essential part of NLP and is used in tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization."
