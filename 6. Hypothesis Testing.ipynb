    "#### Type I and Type II errors are errors that occur in statistical hypothesis testing. A Type I error is a false positive conclusion, meaning that the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. A Type II error is a false negative conclusion, meaning that the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. These errors are unavoidable in hypothesis testing, but can be controlled by choosing appropriate significance levels and sample sizes."

A 95% confidence interval means that if you repeat the same survey or experiment many times with different samples, 95% of the intervals you get will include the true population mean."

    "#### A/B testing (also known as bucket testing, split-run testing, or split testing) is a user experience research methodology. A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment that usually involves two variants (A and B), although the concept can be also extended to multiple variants of the same variable. It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or \"two-sample hypothesis testing\" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare multiple versions of a single variable, for example by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the variants is more effective."

    "#### A hypothesis test can be one or two tailed depending on the sign of the alternative hypothesis. A one-tailed test looks for an increase or decrease in the parameter, and the alternative hypothesis contains either < or > sign. A two-tailed test looks for any change in the parameter, and the alternative hypothesis contains the ≠ sign. The alpha level, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, is divided by two in a two-tailed test and placed in both tails."

    "#### ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance. It is a statistical method used to analyze the differences between the means of two or more groups or treatments. It is often used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of different groups. ANOVA compares the variation between group means to the variation within the groups. If the variation between group means is significantly larger than the variation within groups, it suggests a significant difference between the means of the groups."
